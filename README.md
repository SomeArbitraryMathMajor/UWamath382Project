## Notes
- this was a group project done by a total of two people (Bryan Zang and Jerry Zhou) under the course "Computational Modeling of Cellular Systems" by Professor Brian Ingalls
- this project is a novel extension of existing publications, for educational purposes, all credits go to the rightful owners

## Project Description

- project should involve (i) identifying a published mathematical model, summarizing the system, the model, and the model analysis; (ii) implementing the model computationally, and (iii) extending the model or the analysis in a novel direction and interpreting your findings.
- report format: The final written report should include: (i) an abstract, (ii) an intro- duction, describing the biological system, and explaining why mathematical modelling is useful in this case, and what question(s) the model has been built to address; (iii) sections describing the biological system, the published model, and any published model analysis; (iv) a section describing your own implementation of the model (code can be included, but only as a supplementary appendix); (v) a section describing your novel model extensions or analysis; and (vi) a conclusion, summarizing your findings.
- the major research question should be identified. (Why is this work begin done?) Summarize the main points of the work being considered and comment on its strengths and weaknesses. Motivate your own novel extension of the work. Interpret the results of your analysis. Conclude by placing these specific results in a broader context.
